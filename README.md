# Overview

My game is a two player game that has two space ships fight each other.
the left player uses the WASD keys to move their ship and the left shift to shoot.
The right player uses the direction keys to their ship and the spacebar to shoot.

I wrote this programm to help familiarize myself with making video games useing pygame.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
